<p class="P2">Kathryn Edin took up the subject of how incarceration affects families, in particular father-child relationships and romantic relationships. In several studies consisting of one-on-one interviews with members of 300 families, Edin and her colleagues have found that 40 percent of the new (unmarried) fathers who have just had a child already have a criminal record. And if they are sent back to prison, the incarceration almost always severs relationships with their current partners and can profoundly destabilize their relationships with their children. Edin is an IPR faculty fellow and associate professor of sociology at Northwestern. She is co-author of Promises I Can Keep: Why Poor Women Put Motherhood Before Marriage (University of California Press, forthcoming 2004).</p>
